  ## Conclusion
  The HRMS Leave Management System showcases the development of a fully responsive, interactive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Built during a self-paced internship at VeriTech Software IT Services, this project addresses manual leave management challenges with a structured digital solution.

  Through this experience, I gained practical skills in front-end architecture, UI design, and local data handling. It also strengthened my ability to work independently and manage a project end-to-end. This internship laid a strong foundation for my future in software development and real-time application building.
